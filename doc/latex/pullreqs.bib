	Abstract = {Open source development projects typically support an open bug repository to which both developers and users can report bugs. The reports that appear in this repository must be triaged to determine if the report is one which requires attention and if it is, which developer will be assigned the responsibility of resolving the report. Large open source developments are burdened by the rate at which new bug reports appear in the bug repository. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach intended to ease one part of this process, the assignment of reports to a developer. Our approach applies a machine learning algorithm to the open bug repository to learn the kinds of reports each developer resolves. When a new report arrives, the classifier produced by the machine learning technique suggests a small number of developers suitable to resolve the report. With this approach, we have reached precision levels of 57% and 64% on the Eclipse and Firefox development projects respectively. We have also applied our approach to the gcc open source development with less positive results. We describe the conditions under which the approach is applicable and also report on the lessons we learned about applying machine learning to repositories used in open source development.},

The first one is to find important variables for interpretation and the second one is more restrictive and try to design a good parsimonious prediction model. The main contribution is twofold: to provide some experimental insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and to propose a strategy involving a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy.},

	research suggests that social coding sites such as GitHub provide
	a collaborative environment with a high degree of social transparency.
	This makes developers' actions and interactions more visible and
	trackable.
	
	We conducted interviews with 33 active users of GitHub to investigate
	how the increased transparency found on GitHub in- fluences developers'
	testing behaviors. Subsequently, we validated our findings with an
	online questionnaire that was answered by 569 members of GitHub.
	We found several strategies that software developers and managers
	can use to positively influence the testing behavior in their projects.
	However, project owners on GitHub may not be aware of them. We report
	on the challenges and risks this creates and suggest guidelines for
	promoting a sustainable testing culture in software development projects.},

	Abstract = {The adoption of distributed version control (DVC), such as Git and Mercurial, in open-source software (OSS) projects has been explosive. Why is this and how are projects using DVC? This new generation of version control supports two important new features: distributed repositories and histories that preserve branches and merges. Through interviews with lead developers in OSS projects and a quantitative analysis of mined data from the histories of sixty project, we find that the vast majority of the projects now using DVC continue to use a centralized model of code sharing, while using branching much more extensively than before their transition to DVC. We then examine the Linux history in depth in an effort to understand and evaluate how branches are used and what benefits they provide. We find that they enable natural collaborative processes: DVC branching allows developers to collaborate on tasks in highly cohesive branches, while enjoying reduced interference from developers working on other tasks, even if those tasks are strongly coupled to theirs.},

	Abstract = {For many economic and technological reasons, companies are increasingly conducting projects on a global level. Global projects are highly distributed, with experts from different companies, countries, and continents working together. Such distribution requires new techniques for project coordination, document management, and communication. Distribution complexities include various project types - such as global, interorganizational, or open source software projects - that is distributed in different ways and face particular challenges. A literature-based taxonomy identifies four distribution dimensions in distributed software development. A case study illustrates their application in a real-world development project},
